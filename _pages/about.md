I was born in February 1999 in Shanghai, China. I obtained my B.Eng. degree and my M.Eng. degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2021 and 2024, respectively. I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Urban Mobility Institute](http://umi.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University.

I am honored to be supervised by [Professor Chi Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LQ3KKYQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at Transport and Energy Systems Laboratory (TESLA) since August 2024. I have completed a pre-dissertation research on subsidy reallocation in a containerized freight transportation network. My current research focuses on multimodal traffic assignment (incorporating car-hailing, ridesharing, carpooling, bus, etc.) and travel demand management (e.g., road pricing, tradable credit scheme, booking cum rationing) in a dynamic context.
